1.Do you have any previous programming experience? If so, what language(s)? If not, what are your initial 
thoughts about the C language and this course?

-Yes, I do have some programming experience. I was always interested in programming so I learned how to code in Java. 
I learned for loop, while loop, sorting and few basic commands. I also tried to teach myself in Python but did not go well.


2. Describe your understand of the compiling process of turning a C text file into an executable program.

- Programmer create a source code on C program and compiler take that source code to chnage it to binary code which is machine language. 
Binary code executes the program to take input and shows the output for the users.


3. What do you hope to achieve in this course? Describe your goals and expectations.

- My final goal is to get a job in Google. I have few friends who are currently working in Silicon Valley and 
I visited them couple years ago. They gave me tours during the working day and I aboslutely loved their life style and working enviornment.
They also told me that they mostly code in C++ language. 
I want to learn not only how to code efficiently but also the fundamentals of the language.
